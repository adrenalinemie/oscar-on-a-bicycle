            "content_html": "<p id=\"calibre_pb_2\" class=\"noindentp\"><strong class=\"calibre4\">The southern half of the Outer Hebrides is made up of a long chain of diverse islands. The Uists, which seem more water than land, are joined by a causeway, as is little Eriskay. Lying not far south of them, Barra and the Barra Isles are reached by ferry.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">These beautiful remote isles are world famous for their spectacular beaches. Some are vast and stretch on for miles, like West Beach on Berneray and Tràigh Eais on Barra, and here you can take cover below high dunes and enjoy watching dramatic waves on stormy days. Others are more sheltered bays, like the Prince’s Strand on Eriskay and the east beach on Vatersay, where you can enjoy picnics or wild swimming in the clear, luminescent water.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">On North Uist the landscape of wild peat moors and cultivated crofts is a maze of innumerable trout-filled lochs and inlets – more than half the ‘land’ here is water. Further down the chain, South Uist is a rugged and mountainous island where long sea lochs indent the east coast. In the summer months there is an explosion of colourful wildflowers on the machair plains of these islands. Carpets of harebells, clovers and orchids bloom, and long coastal grasses grow despite often hostile weather conditions. If fauna rather than flora is what you seek, you will find an impressive variety of native and visiting birds both on- and offshore and at the RSPB Balranald nature reserve.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">A 40-minute ferry journey south from Eriskay (the real Whisky Galore island) brings you to beautiful Barra, a popular island with a strong Hebridean character, where more than half of the population still speak Gaelic. Joined to its southern end by a causeway is the peaceful and remote isle of Vatersay, which is so deeply indented by the sea on both sides that only a narrow strip of land prevents it separating into two. Both islands, like the Uists, offer plenty of opportunities for wild camping or longer breaks in charming, traditional self-catering cottages. The ‘long chain’ is also a popular route with cyclists, who can stop overnight at many of the great hostels and campsites along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">The best time to visit is in May or June; this is before the midges arrive, when the machair is in bloom and you’re most likely to have sunshine as you take in the glowing expanses of white sand and bright azure sea at some of the most wonderful beaches in Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"calibre_pb_2\" class=\"noindentp\"><strong class=\"calibre4\">A journey to the northernmost islands in the Outer Hebrides – Lewis and Harris and St Kilda – is a memorable experience at any time of year. These isolated, windswept and mostly treeless islands hold some of the most outstanding landscapes in the world.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">Begin your Hebridean adventure by sailing to the principle island, Lewis and Harris. Commonly taken for two islands, it is in fact just one, but of two distinct characters. The northern part, Lewis, is largely a low-lying land of pool-mottled peat bogs, although it also contains Stornoway, the most populous town in the Hebrides and the centre of Gaelic culture and speech. The island is home to a lively working population with strong traditional and religious values. Many of the islanders belong to one of the five Presbyterian churches and you’ll still find that almost all shops are closed on Sundays.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">As you travel south into Harris there’s a dramatic shift in the terrain. The landscapes suddenly become wild and rugged, the expanses of flat moorlands broken up by dark mountains and surrounded by spectacular beaches. A great place to experience all of these is at Losgaintir, where miles of pristine white sand and glassy azure-green water contrast with more distant views of the forbidding North Harris mountains.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">Both areas are full of ancient treasures: step inside the magically reconstructed Iron Age house at Bosta or spend the night in one of the traditional blackhouses at Gearrannan. You can swim here before watching the sun set over the bay where women and children would have waited anxiously for their men to return from sea on small fishing boats.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">If you visit between April and September and the weather is on your side, you might also make the long, rough boat journey to the islands on ‘the edge of the world’, the exceptionally isolated archipelago of St Kilda. These islands, lying over 100 miles west of the mainland, form one of a very few World Heritage Sites to hold status for both natural and cultural merits. They have a truly fascinating history and boast breathtakingly dramatic scenery, with a series of staggering, dark sea stacks scattered in the sea around towering cliffs. These host puffins, petrels and gannets, while rare-breed sheep descended from ancient flocks survive on the islands. You might have to make a few attempts to get there, but visiting these islands is a truly powerful experience and one you will never forget.</p>",

We had planned to take a third and last train to Stirling, the starting point of the adventure... But... all the trains were cancelled that day. Damned! Plan B, we managed to get on a train which dropped us in Dunferline 30 km from Stirling. We actually started to cycle a day earlier than expected and it turned out to be a nice warm-up on a quiet and easy off-road cycle path. We even managed to arrive before dusk and had a short stroll in the quaint Stirling town centre.

It started with a gentle but steady climb along the river Lochay which then suddenly became much harder as the small gravel road climbed steeply up to a pass via a series of hairpin turns. We had to push the bikes a few times when the slope was too steep to pedal but it was well worth the effort. Then after that riding on the rocky path along Loch Lyon was tough and very technical but definitely rewarding as well. The panorama on the loch and further down the glen was breathtaking.</p>\n<p>This was the first wild camping night was planned but the weather was threatening and very windy, which had the benefit of keeping the midges at bay. Luckily, we were able to shelter in a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/56°32'36.5\" n=\"\" 4=\"\" 35=\"\" 23=\"\" 1=\"\" w=\"\">disused sheep sheering hut </a>full of huge torn open wool bags where we pitched our tent and had a very good night.</p>\n<p>The following day we continued our way along the loch and had to cross quite a few fords, which Oscar enjoyed a lot. It took us a few hours to cycle back to civilisation at the Bridge of Orchy. Overall this route was absolutely stunning but certainly more suitable for MTBs (we saw a few) than gravel bikes. Still, we were very impressed by our Niner bikes, even if it was hard work. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_171547.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_171547-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Mel riding by the Loch Lyon</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_163723.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_163723-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Loch Lyon dam</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01890.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01890-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>One of our finest night in a semi abandoned sheep shearing hut</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01905.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01905-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>One of the many ford crossing too deep to ride on the way down</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01903.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01903-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Throwing pebbles in the river.

We followed a small winding road along the River Orchy. I seemed pretty but to be honest we just kept pushing hard for a few hours, during which Oscar had a long nap nested in the warmth of his trailer. We allowed ourselves a small detour and a short pause to dry off and buy smoked salmon, hot drinks and cake at <a href=\"https://www.smokedsalmon.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inverawe smokehouses</a>. Finally, we stopped for the night in a rustic hut found on AirBnB a couple of days ago. Nonetheless, it was a very welcome stop which allowed us to dry our drenched gear around the wood burner and to rest our legs after this long rainy day. </p>\n<p>The following day was much drier and we only had a short distance to get to Oban. We followed the National cycle route 78 through the stunningly beautiful glen Lonan, where we ran away from a  mildly aggressive herd of Highland cows charging us out of their land. We arrived in Oban just before noon, but had to rush buying so extra wet weather cycling gear (in anticipation for the dire forecast). At the end of the day, we grab sandwiches and jumped into the ferry to the Hebrides without having time to sample Oban's renowned freshly caught shellfish on the seafood huts by the pier.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_133642.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_133642-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a>\n<figcaption>Under the rain near loch Awe</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_161535.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_161535-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Quick stop to dry at Inverawe Smokehouses</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_172504.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_172504-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Taking a \"shortcut\" near Taynuilt</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_092940.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_092940-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Maid's hut in Taynuilt</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_184804.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_184804-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a>\n<figcaption>Mini-bath for Oscar</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_100057.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_100057-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Through the beautiful Glen Lonan</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01914.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01914-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Glen Lonan's killer highland cows</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01919.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01919-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Oban ferry terminal to the islands</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>",

It was a fantastic holiday, but we took it easy because Oscar was only 1 year old. I rode my old  Specialized mountain bike and Melanie had a lightweight CUBE hybrid bike, that got stolen since 😭. Good bikes, but definitely not suitable for long distance touring.</p>\n<p>This year we both have brand new Niner RLT9 gravel bikes from Mike at <a href=\"https://www.stage1cycles.co.uk/\">Stage1Cycle</a> in the middle of the Yorkshire Dales.  We were supposed to get them in April/May 2020, but then COVID19 happened. Long story short, Mike managed to get the 2 Niner framesets during the lockdown and assembled the bikes with the components we wanted. As soon as the lockdown was lifted in June, we swiftly drove up to collect our bikes and explored the stunning Yorkshire Dales National park. Since then we rode pretty much every weekend progressively increasing the distance, technical difficulty and load.</p>\n<p>We also \"trained\" Oscar to get used to spend time in his tout-terrain trailer. And it payed off. He is now happy to stay entire days harnessed in the trailer, singing, asking hundreds of questions or just observing nature quietly. We just need to have a small break every 1 or 2 hours, so he can burn his energy by running around, screaming and chasing birds (or anything else that moves really).</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01686.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01686-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_112502-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_112502-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00786-2.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00786-2-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200620_143222-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200620_143222-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_111837-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_111837-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200822_170312-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200822_170312-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00676-2.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00676-2-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00771-2.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00771-2-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00801-3.JPG\" data-size=\"3672x4896\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00801-3-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01688.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01688-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01607.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01607-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01580.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01580-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Itinerary overview</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.visitouterhebrides.co.uk/see-and-do/activities/hebridean-way/hebridean-way-cycling-route\">Hebridean way</a> was on our list of near mythical route to ride for quite some time. But, the north coast of Spain was also quite high on that list... Well, at least COVID19 helped us to decide where to go for our first big cycle touring adventure. Our planned itinerary starts from the city of Stirling, easily accessible by train and will get us through the magical lochs of the Trossachs before reaching Oban. From there we will board a ferry to the little island of Barra. For nearly a week, we will cycle North through Eriksay, South and North Uist, Benbecula, Grimsay, Berneray and finally Lewis and Harris. Then we will cross the sea back to Ullapool on the mainland and will slowly join Inverness, where our tour will end. Well at least that's our plan...</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/Scotland_map-en2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-xs.png 300w ,https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-sm.png 480w ,https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-md.png 749w ,https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-xl.png 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"></figure>\n<h2>COVID-19 means planning everything </h2>\n<p>It's not our habit but because of COVID-19 we decided to plan most of the nights. It was particularly hard to find accommodations on the Hebrides where pretty much everything is still closed for business until 2021 or already fully booked months in advance. Overall, the Hebrides managed quite well to keep the virus out and people are still reluctant to reopen the islands to mainland tourists. At the end of the day we managed to book 9 out of 14 nights, leaving just a few nights for wild camping or last minute B&amp;B. We planned a couple of nights in a beautiful cottage on Lewis, roughly in the middle of the trip so we can rest a bit to recharge our batteries.</p>\n<p><strong>Scotland, here we come !</strong></p>",
